  name: Security settings analysis
  shortDescription: Shows security issues in Kentico admin settings and `web.config` settings.
  longDescription: |
    Each security issue is accompanied by a short reason for the recommendation.
    
    It is critical that passwords are stored securely in the database. Since Kentico 10, the recommended and most secure password format is `PBKDF2`. For more, see [Setting the user password format](https://docs.kentico.com/k12sp/securing-websites/designing-secure-websites/securing-user-accounts-and-passwords/setting-the-user-password-format).
    
    Checks the following security settings in the `web.config`:
    * Cookieless authentication
    * Compilation debug
    * Custom errors
    * Http-only cookies
    * Viewstate usage
    * Tracing
    * CSRF protection 
    * Hash string salt
    * Session fixation
